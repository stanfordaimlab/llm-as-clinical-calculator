<h2>EVIDENCE APPRAISAL</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although in the initial derivation and validation studies a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 was associated with a low annual stroke risk of 1.9 and 0.8% respectively, subsequent studies have found that patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 may have up to a 3.2% per year risk of ischemic stroke (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15477396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gage 2004</a>).</li>
<li>The derivation study, published in 2001, was a retrospective review of the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation involving 1,733 patients and 2,121 patient years (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15477396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gage 2004</a>).
<ul>
<li>It compared the performance of the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score to two previously established stroke risk(AFI and SPAF III).</li>
<li>Found that the CHADS<sub>2</sub> was the most accurate at predicting future stroke risk, with risk increasing by a factor of 1.5 for every additional point in a subject&rsquo;s score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The validation study included 2,580 subjects with non-valvular AF who were started on aspirin and found that the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score could successfully risk stratify patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401607" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gage 2001</a>).
<ul>
<li>A score of 0 translated into a 0.8% annual stroke risk in this cohort, potentially making these patients appropriate for forgoing oral anticoagulation.</li>
<li>Patients with a score of 1-2 had a 2.7% annual stroke risk.</li>
<li>Patients with a score of 3 or more had a stroke risk of 5.3% up to 18.2% for subjects with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 6.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A study of the Danish National Patient Registry identified 146,251 patients with non-valvular AF and found that 47,576 had a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 or 1 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22473219" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olesen 2012</a>).
<ul>
<li>19,444 had a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 and the <calculator id="801">CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score</calculator> was applied to these patients.</li>
<li>Authors found that in patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 but a <calculator id="801">CHA₂DS₂-VASc</calculator> score of 3 (if they had all three risk factors not accounted for by CHADS<sub>2</sub>) that this cohort was at a 3.2% annual risk of stroke.</li>
<li>In contrast, patients with a <calculator id="801">CHA₂DS₂-VASc</calculator> score of 0 was considered to be &ldquo;truly low risk&rdquo; with an annual ischemic stroke risk of 0.82%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Among 541 patients with non-valvular AF (of <span>&gt;</span>48 hours duration) who underwent electrical cardioversion, 136 had a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 but 14 of those patients were found to have atrial thrombus on echocardiography, suggesting that the score missed 10% of patients who would have been at a high risk for a thromboembolic stroke after cardioversion (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22503581" target="_blank ">Yarmohammadi H 2012</a>).</li>
