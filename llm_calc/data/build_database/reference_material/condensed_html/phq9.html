<h2>FORMULA</h2>
<p>Addition of the selected points.</p>
<h2>FACTS & FIGURES</h2>
<p>The PHQ-9 is a validated, 9-question tool to assess for the degree of depression present in an individual; the last question is not scored, but is useful functionally to help the clinician assess the impact of the patient's symptoms on his or her life.</p>
<h2>EVIDENCE APPRAISAL</h2>
<p>The PHQ-9 was initially developed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556941" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kroenke et al (2001)</a>, as a subset of 9 questions from the full PHQ, which had previously been derived and studied in a cohort of 6,000 patients in 8 primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10568646" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spitzer 1999</a>). PHQ-9 scores &ge;10 were found to be 88% sensitive and also 88% specific for detecting MDD. Criterion validity was also assessed in a sample of 580 patients.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644190" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arroll et al (2010)</a> validated the PHQ-9 as a screener for MDD in a cohort of 2,642 primary care patients and found slightly higher specificity (91%) and lower sensitivity (74%) at the same cutoff of 10 points.</p>
<p>The PHQ-9 has also been validated in several additional subpopulations, including in psychiatric patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beard 2016</a>), patients with medical comorbidities such as multiple sclerosis (Ferrando 2007) and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chagas 2013</a>), pregnant patients (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sidebottom 2012</a>), and in an occupational health setting (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26377480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volker 2016</a>).</p>
<p>A&nbsp;meta-analysis of 29 studies including 6,725 patients found similar&nbsp;sensitivity (88%, 95%&nbsp;CI&nbsp;83-92%) and&nbsp;specificity (85%, 95% CI&nbsp;82-88%) for a cutoff of &ge;10 as did the previous studies, both overall and for subgroups.&nbsp;Notably, they found that when used in the&nbsp;primary care setting, only approximately&nbsp;50% of patients&nbsp;screening&nbsp;positive on the PHQ-9 in fact had major depression (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Levis 2019</a>).</p>
