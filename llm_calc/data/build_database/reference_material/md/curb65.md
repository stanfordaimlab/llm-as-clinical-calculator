## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The original study was a retrospective review of three prospective
studies of CAP in the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It included
a total of 1068 patients. A five-point score based on confusion, urea,
respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age was developed to stratify
patients into different treatment group based on mortality risk. The
validation study was done in India and included 150 patients.

CURB-65's original study including co-morbidity variables like chronic
lung disease, chronic liver disease, CHF, CVD, and DM, and these were
controlled for when developing the relevant criteria for the risk
stratification that ultimately led to CURB-65's risk factors.

Several other more recent validation studies in several different
countries show increasing mortality and even need for intubation with
increasing CURB-65 scores, ranging from 0-1.1% (CURB-65 score = 0) to
17-60% (CURB-65 score = 5), with over 3100 patients in these studies
when combined.
