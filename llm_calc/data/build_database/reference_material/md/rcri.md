## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

[]{#docs-internal-guid-d78f3d5b-7fff-c1b5-f5d0-b3ec99cead67}Since the
original study was published by [Goldman et al in
1977](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/904659){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, a systematic review by [Ford et al
(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20048269){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} including 792,740 patients from 24 studies found the
RCRI showed risk of major cardiovascular events (including death) was
2-10 times higher than previously reported. There are two drivers of
this effect: the routine use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin over
creatinine kinase, and the inclusion of validation studies that enrolled
patients undergoing emergent surgery. It revealed moderate
discrimination of major perioperative cardiac complications between low
and high risk patients. The RCRI did not perform well in predicting
death in all-comers, due to high heterogeneity between studies, and
cardiovascular events in patients undergoing vascular surgery.

Beyond this systematic review, data from a total of four prospective
studies and one retrospective study were combined to calculate the
pooled event rates for each of the RCRI scores ([Duceppe
2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27865641){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}). Only one of the studies, the [VISION Pilot
Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22567075){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, actually had the goal of prospectively validating the
RCRI.

The [VISION Pilot
Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22567075){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} is a large, multicenter, international prospective
cohort study of 432 adults \>45 years old who underwent noncardiac
surgery with either regional or general anesthetic. All patients had
their troponin measured post-operatively in the PACU and daily for 72
hours. The primary composite outcome was vascular death, nonfatal MI,
non-fatal cardiac arrest, and nonfatal strokes. One objective of the
study was to prospectively validate the RCRI criteria using a composite
outcome of MI, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation, and complete
heart block. The event rates based on RCRI criteria were 2.2% for an
RCRI of 0, 8.2% for RCRI of 1, 5.3% for an RCRI of 2, and 36.4% for an
RCRI of ≥3.

[Rajagopalan et al
(2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18586440){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} prospectively collected NT-ProBNP as well as troponins
measured immediately after surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3,
and 5 in a cohort of 136 patients undergoing elective vascular surgery
for AAA or sub-critical limb ischemia. The objective of the study was to
assess the efficacy of NT-ProBNP elevation as a predictor of elevated
troponins. Their primary outcome was elevation of troponin-I \>0.1 ng/mL
. The data had appropriate patient characteristics and endpoints and
therefore event rates could be calculated based on RCRI scores and
included in the pooled estimates (Duceppe 2017; Sheth 2015).

[Ausset et al
(2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17666156){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} prospectively measured troponin levels in 88 patients
undergoing elective hip surgery on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3.
Positive elevation in troponin level was noted to be 0.08 ng/mL. All
patients had their RCRI calculated and event rates were displayed in the
results. Interestingly, the study went on to assess whether these
elevated troponin measurement were associated with major cardiac events
within the first year following surgery and they showed that 45.5% of
patients with elevated troponins in the first 3 days following surgery
had major cardiac events, while only 3.9% of those who did not have
elevated troponins did.

[Sheth et al
(2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25902738){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, in association with the Coronary CTA VISION study
group, published a large international multicentre prospective cohort
study in which 955 patients with (or at risk of) CAD undergoing
non-cardiac surgery. Each patient had preoperative coronary CTA in order
to assess if burden of stenosis seen on CTA was a useful predictor of
perioperative cardiovascular death and MI within 30 days of surgery.
RCRI data was collected for each patient and therefore rates of outcome
could be stratified by RCRI data and included in the pooled estimate.
Vast over-estimation of risk in those who did not have events was
demonstrated.

Myocardial injury in non-cardiac surgery (MINS), defined as cardiac
biomarker elevation post-surgically, is an important prognostic marker.
Studies consistently show increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes and
mortality both in the short-term and long-term. This prompted the 2018
RCT of dabigatran in patients with MINS
([MANAGE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900874){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}) which revealed an absolute risk reduction from 15% to
11% with 110 mg BID of dabigatran in the composite outcome: major
vascular complication, a composite of vascular mortality and non-fatal
myocardial infarction, non-haemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial
thrombosis, amputation, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism
([Devereaux
2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900874){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}).

The likely explanation for these differences is that the original RCRI
study monitored creatine kinase muscle and brain isoenzyme (CK-MB) and
excluded emergency surgery patients, whereas the external validation
studies monitored troponin measurements that are much more sensitive
than creatine kinase muscle and brain isoenzyme, and some studies
included emergency surgery patients.

A large scale external validation using 34,000 patients and update of
the renal variable is underway using data from the VISION study by the
Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) at McMaster University. The
trial registration is currently
available: [https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e013510](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/1/e013510){target="_blank"
