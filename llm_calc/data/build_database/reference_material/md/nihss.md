## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

-   The first iteration of the NIH stroke scale was derived by Brott et
    al in a pilot study of 10 patients who were evaluated within 3-weeks
    of having an ischemic stroke.  Authors applied the Toronto Stroke
    Scale, the Oxbury Initial Severity Scale and the Cincinnati Stroke
    Scale to these patients, analysed the results and then created a
    composite scale. This was intended for use in an NIH-sponsored trial
    of naloxone for stroke ([Brott
    1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2749846){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   Brott's Cincinnati/Naloxone stroke scale was modified by Lyden and
    colleagues (1994) for use in the National Institute of Neurological
    Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) study on tissue plasminogen activator
    (tPA) in patients with ischemic stroke ([NINDS
    1995](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199512143332401){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   A retrospective review of 1281 subjects with ischemic stroke found
    that for every 1 point increase in the NIHSS decreased the
    likelihood of an excellent outcome by 24% at 7 days and 17% at 3
    months ([Adams
    1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10408548){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   In a trial of 94 patients, authors found that  each 1 point increase
    in the NIHSS when performed within 24 hours of the stroke correlated
    with a decreased likelihood of the patient being discharged
    ([Schlegel
    2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12511764){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   A study of 893 patients found that their initial NIHSS score
    (performed within 72 hours of the ischemic event) was predictive of
    whether the patient would need to be placed in a nursing home or
    need to be sent to rehabilitation.  Patients with moderate (6-13
    points) or severe (\>14 points) NIHSS scores were 3 times more
    likely to be placed in a nursing home after discharge and 8 more
    times likely to require rehabilitation therapy ([Rundek
    2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11071497){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   A study of 377 patients found that when performed 24-48 hours after
    an ischemic stroke, that the NIHSS was broadly predictive of group
    outcomes at 1-year, with 75% of patients who had a score of 4 or
    less being functionally independent ([Appelros
    2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14530634){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
    -   Median score in this study was 6, with 33% of patients dying
        within the first year after their event.
-   A prospective trial of 54 patients found that combining diffusion
    weighted MRI imaging with the NIHSS score was more predictive of
    clinical outcomes at 3 months (70%) than with using the score (43%)
    or imaging (54%) alone ([Yoo
    2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20595665){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   In an analysis of 312 subjects from the NINDS trials, authors found
    that an NIHSS of \>20 was associated with a 17% rate of intracranial
    hemorrhage with tPA vs. a 3% hemorrhage rate in patients with a
    score of \<10 ([The NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group
    1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9368550){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
