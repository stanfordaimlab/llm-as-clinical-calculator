## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

Multiple randomized trials and observational studies support use of
symptom-triggered treatment (using CIWA-Ar) over fixed-schedule
treatment (in which benzodiazepines are given at fixed intervals) or
vitals-triggered treatment.

Superior clinical endpoints include:

-   Decreased frequency of oversedation in patients with milder alcohol
    withdrawal.

-   Decreased frequency of under-treatment in patients with greater
    severity of withdrawal.

-   Shorter periods of hospitalization.

-   Lower incidence of delirium tremens ([Wartenburg
    1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2178476){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Saitz
    1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8046805){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Mayo-Smith
    1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9214531){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Reoux
    2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10934575){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Jaeger
    2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11444401){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Nuss
    2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15119493){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).

There is also some evidence for combined symptom-triggered and
fixed-schedule treatment utilizing CIWA-Ar ([Daeppen
2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12020181){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}).

The original CIWA-A, published by [Shaw et al in
1981](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7334148/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, was developed to assess the severity of alcohol
withdrawal, both to monitor response to treatment and for use in
research. The CIWA-Ar developed by [Sullivan et al
(1989)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2597811){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} eliminated several redundant and ineffective items to
increase the scale's efficiency while retaining clinical usefulness,
validity and reliability. This article proposes the CIWA-Ar scale as a
shortened version of the original CIWA-A scale.

[Reoux](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10934575){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} and colleagues compared routine hospital alcohol
detoxification practice with CIWA-Ar-based as-needed protocol in a
retrospective chart review and found fewer total chlordiazepoxide
milligram equivalents used over a shorter duration with utilization of
CIWA-Ar.
