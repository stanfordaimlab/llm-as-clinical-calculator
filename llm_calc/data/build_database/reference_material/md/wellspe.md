## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

-   The original Wells study was performed on cohorts where prevalence
    of PE was high: approximately 30%. Two further emergency department
    studies validated this tool with a 9.5%-12% PE prevalence.
-   The largest study demonstrated risk stratification with:
    -   Low score of 0-1 having a 1.3% prevalence.
    -   Moderate score of 2-6 having a 16.2% prevalence.
    -   High score of \>6 having a 37.5% prevalence.
-   The Christopher study divided the Wells scoring system into 2
    categories:
    -   A score of 4 or less was defined as "PE unlikely" and tested
        with a d-dimer.
    -   A score of 5 or more was defined as "PE likely" and went
        straight to CTA
-   Overall Incidence of PE was 12.1% in the "unlikely" group vs. 37.1%
    in the "likely" group.
-   If dimer was negative no further testing was performed.
-   If dimer was positive the patient went to CTA.
-   20.4% of all patients who went to CTA had a diagnosis of PE.
-   In the "PE unlikely" group, those with a negative dimer and
    discharged to home had an incidence of missed PE on 3 month follow
    up of 0.5% .
