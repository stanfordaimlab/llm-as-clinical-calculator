## FACTS & FIGURES

-   Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) was defined in this study as:
    AMI, PCI, CABG, death.
-   Ryan Radecki of EM Literature of Note [recommended emergency
    physicians use the HEART
    Score](https://www.emlitofnote.com/?p=440){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"} over the TIMI or GRACE scores for emergency
    department risk stratification of patients with possibly cardiac
    complaints.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The HEART Score was originally developed by [Backus et al
(2008)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2442661/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} in a cohort of 122 patients with chest pain in an
emergency department setting. The study included any patients admitted
to the emergency department due to chest pain irrespective of age,
prehospital assumptions, and previous medical treatments. It excluded
patients with chest pain and significant ST segment elevations.
Endpoints in this study were acute myocardial infarction (AMI),
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG), and death. HEART Scores of 0-3 points confer a risk of 2.5% for
any endpoint and therefore was used to support discharge from the ED.
Conversely, scores 4-6 points confer a risk of 20.3%, implying admission
for clinical observation is necessary. ≥7 points has a risk of 72.7% and
supports early invasive strategies.

In a retrospective multicenter validation study also by [Backus et al
(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20802272){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, 880 patients presenting with chest pain were evaluated.
The primary endpoints studied were the same as the original study. 158
patients (17.95%) reached the primary endpoint. Of the 303 patients with
HEART Scores 0 to 3, three (0.99%) had a MACE. In 413 patients with
scores 4 to 6, 48 cases (11.6%) resulted in a MACE, and in HEART Scores
7 to 10, MACE was identified in 107/164 cases (65.2%).

[Backus et
al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465250){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} externally validated the HEART Score with a prospective
multicenter study in 2013. The study evaluated 2,440 patients presenting
with chest pain to 10 emergency departments in the Netherlands. The
primary endpoint was the occurrence of any MACE within 6 weeks. The
performance of the HEART Score was also compared to that of the TIMI
Score for UA/NSTEMI and the GRACE ACS Risk Score. In the low risk group
(score 0-3), 15/870 (1.7%) of patients were found to have a MACE. In
patients with HEART scores 4-6, MACE was diagnosed in 183/1101 (16.6%).
In patients with high HEART scores (values 7-10), MACE occurred in
50.1%. The c-statistic of the HEART score (0.83) was significantly
higher than the c-statistic of TIMI (0.75) and GRACE (0.70) respectively
(p \<0.0001).

[Poldervaart et al
(2017)](https://annals.org/aim/article/2622872/effect-using-heart-score-patients-chest-pain-emergency-department-stepped){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} studied the HEART Score in a stepped-wedge cluster
randomized trial with the objective of measuring both outcomes and use
of healthcare resources. Nine Dutch hospitals were included in the study
and were instructed to start usual care when assessing patients with
chest pain. Every six weeks, one hospital was randomly assigned to use
the HEART Score to assess patients with chest pain. A total of 3,648
patients were included (1,827 receiving usual care and 1,821 receiving
HEART care). The study found that the six-week MACE incidence while
using the HEART Score was 1.3% lower than with usual care, but there
were no statistically significant differences in early discharge,
readmissions, recurrent emergency department visits, outpatient visits,
or visits to general practitioners.

Recent studies have compared the HEART Score head-to-head with other
clinical decision rules with regards to their ability to safely identify
low risk patients. A study by [Poldervaart et al
(2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27810290){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} comparing the HEART Score to the TIMI and GRACE Scores
showed that the HEART Score outperformed the others when identifying low
risk patients, with only 0.8% incidence of MACE in the low risk group.

In addition, [Nieuwets et al
(2016)](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010694){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} compared the HEART Score with the TIMI Score, with
regards to identifying low risk patients without compromising safety
while also evaluating expected cost reduction. They found that the HEART
Score identified more patients as low risk compared with the TIMI Score,
which would have led to potential cost savings of €64,107 (\~USD
\$76,000) by using the HEART Score cutoffs versus €14,670 (\~USD
\$17,000) for TIMI.

The HEART Pathway developed by [Mahler et al
(2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25737484){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} combined the HEART Score with 0- and 3-hour cardiac
troponin tests in a decision aid designed to identify ED patients safe
for early discharge. The study found that the HEART Pathway decreased
length of stay by 12 hours, decreased objective cardiac testing by 12%,
and increased early discharges by 21%. No MACE were seen within 30 days
in patients who were identified for early discharge. Of note, this study
(and the original HEART Score studies) uses regular sensitivity cardiac
troponin.
