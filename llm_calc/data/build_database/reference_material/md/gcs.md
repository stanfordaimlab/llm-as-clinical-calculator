## FORMULA

The Glasgow Coma **Score **is calculated by addition of the total points
selected under each component (eye, verbal, motor) below, e.g. \"15
points\".

The Glasgow Coma **Scale** is comprised of the individual components,
e.g. \"E(4) V(5) M (6)\".

  ----------- ------------------------------- --------

\*Individual components may be not testable due to any of the following
(note this is not a comprehensive list):

-   **Eye:** local injury and/or edema.
-   **Verbal:** intubation.
-   **All (eye, verbal, motor):** sedation, paralysis, and ventilation
    eliminating all responses.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

-   The Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (the 15-point scale that has been
    widely adopted, including by the original unit in Glasgow, as
    opposed to the 14 point original GCS Scale) was developed to be used
    in a repeated manner in the inpatient setting to assess and
    communicate changes in mental status and to measure the duration of
    coma ([Teasdale
    1974)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4136544){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}.
-   The evidence in 53 published reports on the reproducibility of the
    scale was synthesised in a systematic review by [Reith et
    al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564211){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}. 85% of the findings in higher quality studies
    showed substantial reliability as judged by the standard criterion
    of a kappa statistic (k) above 0.6. Reproducibility of the total GCS
    Score was also high, with kappa greater than 0.6 in 77% of
    observations. Education and training on usage of the scale resulted
    in A clear beneficial effect on reliability ([Reith
    2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26564211){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   In its most common usage, the three sections of the scale are often
    summed to provide a summary of severity. The authors themselves have
    explicitly objected to the score being used in this way, and
    analysis has shown that patients with the same total score can have
    huge variations in outcomes, specifically mortality (GCS score of 4
    predicts a mortality rate of 48% if calculated 1+1+2 for eye,
    verbal, and motor, a mortality of 27% if calculated 1+2+1, but a
    mortality of only 19% if calculated 2+1+1 ([Healey
    2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12707528){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).

In summary, the Modified Glasgow Coma Scale provides a nearly
universally accepted method of assessing patients with acute brain
damage. Summation of its components into a single overall score loses
information and provides only a rough guide to severity. In some
circumstances, such as early triage of severe injuries, assessment of
only a contracted version of the motor component of the scale, as in the
Simplified Motor Scale (SMS) can perform as well the GCS and is
significantly less complicated. However, the SMS may be less informative
in patients with lesser injuries.
