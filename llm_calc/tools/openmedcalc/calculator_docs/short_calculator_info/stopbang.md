## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The STOP-BANG questionnaire was originally developed by [Chung et al in
2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18431116){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}. The focus of this seminal paper is on the STOP
questions in preoperative patients. However, appendix two is the
STOP-BANG questionnaire which includes four objective assessments
alongside of the four STOP questions. By including the BANG assessments
with the STOP questions, the authors increased the sensitivity and
negative predictive value of the screening test.  

STOP-BANG has been studied and validated in multiple settings: 

[Xará
2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323734){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}: High-risk OSA patients (\>3 on STOP-BANG) have a
greater incidence of postoperative respiratory complications including
inability to breathe deeply and episodes of desaturation. 

[Uchôa
2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25612013){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}: OSA is independently associated with an increase in
major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular events following coronary
bypass graft surgery. 

[Tan 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27938922){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, [Nagappa
2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658438){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}: While initially developed for preoperative patients,
STOP-BANG is an effective screen for the general population. 

The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been translated to and validated in
multiple languages including
[Arabic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25758298){target="_blank"

[Portuguese](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832234){target="_blank"
