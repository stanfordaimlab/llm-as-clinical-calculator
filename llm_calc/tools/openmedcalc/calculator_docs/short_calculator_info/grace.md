## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) is a massive,
international database of ACS in 94 hospitals in 14 countries which
gives it excellent external validity *a priori*.

Patients were entered into the study if they had ACS:

-   Signs or symptoms of acute cardiac ischemia **plus**:
    -   EKG findings consistent with ACS or
    -   Cardiac biomarker serial increases consistent with ACS or
    -   Documented coronary artery disease.
-   This ACS could not be secondary to trauma, surgery, or other
    significant co-morbidity.
-   In-hospital mortality status was available in 98.1% of the 11,389
    ACS patients studied.
-   22% of the in-hospital deaths occurred within 24 hours of admission,
    suggesting that this registry contains a very sick cohort of
    patients.

Of note, the GRACE 2.0 evaluated variables for non-linear mortality
associations (thus providing a more accurate estimate of outcome). GRACE
2.0 also includes mortality estimates up to 3 years after the ACS event
via several other data sets with longer followup windows.
