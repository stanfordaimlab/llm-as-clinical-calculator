## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

-   Although in the initial derivation and validation studies a CHADS~2~
    score of 0 was associated with a low annual stroke risk of 1.9 and
    0.8% respectively, subsequent studies have found that patients with
    a CHADS~2~ score of 0 may have up to a 3.2% per year risk of
    ischemic stroke ([Gage
    2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15477396){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   The derivation study, published in 2001, was a retrospective review
    of the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation involving 1,733
    patients and 2,121 patient years ([Gage
    2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15477396){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
    -   It compared the performance of the CHADS~2~ score to two
        previously established stroke risk(AFI and SPAF III).
    -   Found that the CHADS~2~ was the most accurate at predicting
        future stroke risk, with risk increasing by a factor of 1.5 for
        every additional point in a subject's score.

-   The validation study included 2,580 subjects with non-valvular AF
    who were started on aspirin and found that the CHADS~2~ score could
    successfully risk stratify patients ([Gage
    2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401607){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
    -   A score of 0 translated into a 0.8% annual stroke risk in this
        cohort, potentially making these patients appropriate for
        forgoing oral anticoagulation.
    -   Patients with a score of 1-2 had a 2.7% annual stroke risk.
    -   Patients with a score of 3 or more had a stroke risk of 5.3% up
        to 18.2% for subjects with a CHADS~2~ score of 6.
-   A study of the Danish National Patient Registry identified 146,251
    patients with non-valvular AF and found that 47,576 had a CHADS~2~
    score of 0 or 1 ([Olesen
    2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22473219){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
    -   19,444 had a CHADS~2~ score of 0 and the CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score was
        applied to these patients.
    -   Authors found that in patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 but a
        CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 3 (if they had all three risk factors not
        accounted for by CHADS~2~) that this cohort was at a 3.2% annual
        risk of stroke.
    -   In contrast, patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 0 was
        considered to be "truly low risk" with an annual ischemic stroke
        risk of 0.82%.
-   Among 541 patients with non-valvular AF (of \>48 hours duration) who
    underwent electrical cardioversion, 136 had a CHADS~2~ score of 0
    but 14 of those patients were found to have atrial thrombus on
    echocardiography, suggesting that the score missed 10% of patients
    who would have been at a high risk for a thromboembolic stroke after
    cardioversion ([Yarmohammadi H
    2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22503581){target="_blank "}).
