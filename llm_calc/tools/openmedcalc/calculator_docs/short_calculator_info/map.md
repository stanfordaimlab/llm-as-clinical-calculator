# Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

## INPUTS

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Systolic BP                       | **Options:**                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Diastolic BP                      | **Options:**                      |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

## FORMULA

Mean Arterial Pressure = 1/3\*(SBP) + 2/3\*(DBP)

## FACTS & FIGURES

-   A MAP ≥60 mmHg is believed to be needed to maintain adequate tissue
    perfusion.
-   A MAP ≥65 mmHg is recommended in patients with severe sepsis and
    septic shock by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines Committee.

the physiology and the factors that affect blood pressure. It emphasizes
the need to individualize patient management when it comes to blood
patient targets.
