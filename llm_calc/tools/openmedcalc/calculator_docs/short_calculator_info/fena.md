## FORMULA

Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa), % = 100 × (S~Cr~ × U~Na~ ) /
(S~Na~ × U~Cr~)

S~Cr~, serum creatinine; U~Na~, urine sodium; S~Na~, serum sodium;
U~Cr~, urine creatinine.

How the equation is derived:

-   FENa is a measure of tubular resorption of Na.
-   FENa = (Na excreted/Na filtered) x 100.
-   Na excreted = U~Na~ × urine volume.
-   Therefore, Na filtered = P~Na~ × (U~Cr~ × urine volume)/P~Cr~.

                   Pre-Renal   Indeterminate   Intrinsic
  FENa             \<1%        1-2%            \>2%

**Pre-Renal:** Anything causing decreased effective renal perfusion:
hypovolemia, heart failure, renal artery stenosis, sepsis, etc.
Remember, contrast-induced nephropathy will often look pre-renal.

**Intrinsic:** ATN, AIN, glomerulonephritides, etc.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

[Espinel in
1976](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/947239){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} originally described a FENa cutoff of \<1% for pre-renal
azotemia in a study study of 17 adults with oliguria, defined as urine
output \<20mL/hr.  Patients with urinary obstruction, acute
glomerulonephritis, CKD, and diuretic use were excluded.

A FENa cutoff of \<1% for pre-renal azotemia was clinically validated in
a prospective study, though there was overlap between patients with true
pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis.  Specificity for
pre-renal azotemia (with a cutoff of \<1%) was decreased in non-oliguric
acute renal failure ([Miller
1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/666184){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}).

At a normal GFR of 180 L/day and Na concentration of 140 mEq/L, the
filtered sodium load is 25,200 mEq/day (=140 × 180). A FENa of 1% in
this setting represents sodium excretion of 252 mEq/day.  This is higher
than the average sodium intake of 80 to 250 mEq/day. This is the
physiologic basis for hypothesizing that patients with normal GFR have a
FENa below 1%.
