## FORMULA

Scoring information is available in [Appendix 7 in the Goff, et al. 2014
study](https://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/129/25_suppl_2/S49.full.pdf){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}.

## FACTS & FIGURES

-   These estimates may underestimate the 10-year risk for some
    race/ethnic groups, including American Indians, some Asian Americans
    (e.g., of south Asian ancestry), and some Hispanics (e.g., Puerto
    Ricans).
-   It may overestimate the risk for some Asian Americans (e.g., of east
    Asian ancestry) and some Hispanics (e.g., Mexican Americans).
-   Because the primary use of these risk estimates is to facilitate the
    very important discussion regarding risk reduction through lifestyle
    change, the imprecision introduced is small enough to justify
    proceeding with lifestyle change counseling informed by these
    results.

**Optimal Risk Factors**

For the comparison of optimal risk factors, these were defined by the
following specific risk factor numbers for an individual of the same
age, sex and race:

-   Total cholesterol of 170 mg/dL
-   HDL-cholesterol of 50 mg/dL
-   *Untreated* systolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg
-   No diabetes history
-   Not a current smoker

**US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Guidelines**

In 2016, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) made similar but
slightly different
[recommendations](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2584058){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} for adults without a history of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) to use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the prevention of CVD
events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met:

1.  Age 40 to 75 years
2.  1 or more CVD risk factors (ie, dyslipidemia, diabetes,
    hypertension, or smoking)
3.  Calculated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater
    (B recommendation)

The USPSTF gave a B recommendation---indicating high certainty that the
benefit is moderate or moderate certainty that the benefit is moderate
to substantial---for starting low- to moderate-dose statins in adults
ages 40 to 75 years without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
who have one or more CVD risk factors and a 10-year CVD risk of 10% or
greater.

The USPSTF dropped its level of endorsement to C for adults with a lower
10-year risk (7.5%-10%) and made no recommendations for adults 76 years
of age and older, explaining that there was insufficient evidence for
this age group.
