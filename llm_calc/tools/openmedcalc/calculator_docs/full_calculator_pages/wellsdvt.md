Note: there are a few versions of the criteria with minor differences
based on the study; this set is the most widely validated, based on
[Wells
2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14507948){target="_blank"

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

-   Wells\' Criteria were derived from a number of studies by Wells et
    al ([Wells
    1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7752753){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Wells
    1997](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)08140-3/fulltext){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}, [Wells
    2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14507948){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}) in an attempt to stratify risk of DVT in
    symptomatic outpatients, since at the time, the clinical diagnosis
    of DVT was thought to be inaccurate, leading to widespread overuse
    of confirmatory imaging.
-   [Wells
    2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14507948){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"} took 1,096 outpatients with concern for DVT and
    randomized them into two groups after applying Wells' Criteria for
    DVT. 520 were the control and had an ultrasound, 562 were tested
    with a d-dimer. If the dimer was positive these patients also
    received an US. If negative no US was performed. 16% of the control
    group and 15.5 percent of the test group had DVT or PE resulting in
    overall incidence of 15.7%.
-   Of the 520 control patients, 279 were considered DVT unlikely, and
    241 were DVT likely. 16 (5.7%) of the unlikely patients had DVT or
    PE. In the control group overall, 6 (1.4%) patients who had been
    initially ruled out had a diagnosis of DVT on 3 month follow-up.
-   Of the 562 patients in the d-dimer group, 315 were considered
    unlikely and 247 considered likely to have DVT. 71 (28.7%) of the
    likely group had DVT. 38.8 percent of the unlikely group had a
    negative d-dimer and did not undergo further testing. 2 of these
    patients (0.4%) had confirmed DVT on 4 and 14 d follow-up. The
    negative predictive value of d-dimer was 96.1%.
-   This algorithm was then supported by Scarvelis and Wells in 2006
    ([Scarvelis
    2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17060659){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}).
-   A systematic review ([Wells
    2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16403932){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"}) was performed in 2006 which evaluated 14 studies
    with 8239 patients that used the Wells score to predict risk of DVT
    and evaluated for incidence of DVT in association with moderate or
    high sensitivity d-dimer. This has been utilized by the American
    College of Chest physicians to provide guidelines for the evaluation
    of DVT.
