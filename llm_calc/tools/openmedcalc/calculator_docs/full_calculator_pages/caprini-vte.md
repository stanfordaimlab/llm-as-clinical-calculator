# Caprini VTE Risk Assessment Model

The Caprini Risk Assessment Model is a validated tool designed to stratify the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), including Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), particularly after surgery. It calculates risk based on various factors, assigning points to each risk element, which are then summed to provide an overall risk score.

### How is the Caprini Score Calculated?

The Caprini score assigns points for a variety of risk factors across different categories, such as:

- Age: with different points assigned for various age groups.
- Gender: not used for scoring, but included in some assessments to know whether at risk for pregnancy.
- Type of surgery: depending on the nature and duration.
- Recent events: such as major surgery, CHF, or sepsis.
- Venous disease or clotting disorder: including history of DVT/PE, family history, or genetic factors.
- The total score indicates the risk level of VTE, with higher scores correlating with greater risk.

### Risk Levels and Interpretation

- Score 0: Lowest risk, minimal chance of VTE.
- Score 1-2: Low risk.
- Score 3-4: Moderate risk, with a 0.70% risk percent.
- Score 5-6: High risk, with a 1.80% risk percent.
- Score 7-8: Higher risk, with a 4.00% risk percent.
- Score â‰¥9: Highest risk, with a 10.70% risk percent.
