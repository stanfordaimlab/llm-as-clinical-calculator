## FORMULA

If any of the following is/are present, PE cannot be ruled out:

-   Age ≥50.
-   HR ≥100.
-   O₂ sat on room air \<95%.
-   Unilateral leg swelling.
-   Hemoptysis.
-   Recent trauma or surgery.
-   Prior PE or DVT.
-   Hormone use (oral contraceptives, hormone replacement or estrogenic
    hormones use in males or female patients).

## FACTS & FIGURES

If any criteria are positive, the PERC rule is not satisfied and cannot
be used to rule out PE in this patient.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The [original article from
2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304025){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} was a prospective study with a derivation section and a
validation section.

-   3148 patients from 10 sites were included in the derivation.
-   21 potential variables were included for analysis, with the 8 final
    variables selected from these.
-   1427 low-risk and 382 very low-risk patients from 2 sites were
    included in the validation section.
-   In low-risk patients there was a sensitivity of 96% and specificity
    of 27%.
-   In very low-risk patients there was a sensitivity of 100% and
    specificity of 15%.
-   The false negative rate at 90 days in low-risk patients was 1.4%
    which is below the 1.8% testing threshold.

[A second multicenter
validation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18318689){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} was done in 2008. This expanded upon the initial
validation study and defined low pretest probability as \<15%

-   8138 patients from 13 sites were included in the study. Some of
    these sites were included in the initial paper.
-   Clinical gestalt for a pretest probability of \<15%, 15-40% or \>40%
    was collected from the providers.
-   20% of the cohort was deemed low risk (\<15%)
-   For patients who were PERC negative and pre-test probability was
    \<15% the false negative rate at 45 days was 1.0% with a sensitivity
    of 97.4% and specificity of 21.9%.
