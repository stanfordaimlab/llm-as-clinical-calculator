## FORMULA

Per [OPTN policy, January 2016 (pages
4--5)](https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1575/policynotice_20151101.pdf){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}:

Candidates who are at least 12 years old receive an initial MELD(i)
score equal to:

**MELD(i) = 0.957** **×** **ln(Cr) + 0.378** **×** **ln(bilirubin) +
1.120** **×** **ln(INR) + 0.643**

Then, round to the tenth decimal place and multiply by 10. 

If MELD(i) \> 11, perform additional MELD calculation as follows:

**MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32** **×** **(137 -- Na) --  \[ 0.033** **×**
**MELD(i)** **×** **(137 -- Na) \]**

Additional rules:

-   All values in US units (Cr and bilirubin in mg/dL, Na in mEq/L, and
    INR unitless).
-   If bilirubin, Cr, or INR is \<1.0, use 1.0.
-   If any of the following is true, use Cr 4.0:
    -   Cr \>4.0.
    -   ≥2 dialysis treatments within the prior 7 days.
    -   24 hours of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) within
        the prior 7 days.
-   If Na \<125 mmol/L, use 125. If Na \>137 mmol/L, use 137.
-   Maximum MELD = 40.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

MELD was [originally developed in
2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11172350){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} by researchers at the Mayo Clinic to estimate survival
of 231 patients undergoing elective transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and thus coined the "Mayo End Stage
Liver Disease (MELD)" score.

In addition to serum bilirubin, creatinine levels and INR, etiology of
liver disease was included, but subsequently removed due to difficulty
estimating risk in patients with multiple causes of liver disease. The
name was also later changed to Model for End-stage Liver Disease.

In 2002, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) began using a
modified version of the MELD score to prioritize patients on their
orthotopic liver transplantation waiting list. MELD was prospectively
validated in 2003 by [Wiesner et
al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12512033){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} in 3,437 patients awaiting transplant.

Further studies demonstrated that MELD can be used to predict short term
mortality risk in cirrhosis patients with complications such as variceal
bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute hepatic failure and
alcoholic hepatitis. It can also be used in preoperative assessment of
cirrhotics undergoing non-transplant surgery and in HCC patients who are
not candidates for transplant.

In 2006, the MELD Exception Study Group and Conference (MESSAGE) created
the [MELD Exception
Guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17123284){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} for transplant list patients whose mortality was not
accurately predicted by the standard MELD formula.

In March 2007, [Kamath et
al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17326206){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} reported that, though MELD has the ability to rank
cirrhotic patients according to short term mortality, it is not a
perfectly universal score, as survival is not accurately predicted in
15-20% of patients, and users must be aware of limitations of its
application.
