## FORMULA

Addition of the selected points.

## FACTS & FIGURES

The PHQ-9 is a validated, 9-question tool to assess for the degree of
depression present in an individual; the last question is not scored,
but is useful functionally to help the clinician assess the impact of
the patient\'s symptoms on his or her life.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The PHQ-9 was initially developed by [Kroenke et al
(2001)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11556941){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}, as a subset of 9 questions from the full PHQ, which had
previously been derived and studied in a cohort of 6,000 patients in 8
primary care clinics and 7 obstetrics-gynecology clinics ([Spitzer
1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10568646){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}). PHQ-9 scores ≥10 were found to be 88% sensitive and
also 88% specific for detecting MDD. Criterion validity was also
assessed in a sample of 580 patients.

[Arroll et al
(2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20644190){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} validated the PHQ-9 as a screener for MDD in a cohort of
2,642 primary care patients and found slightly higher specificity (91%)
and lower sensitivity (74%) at the same cutoff of 10 points.

The PHQ-9 has also been validated in several additional subpopulations,
including in psychiatric patients ([Beard
2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774513){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}), patients with medical comorbidities such as multiple
sclerosis (Ferrando 2007) and Parkinson's disease ([Chagas
2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23761457){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}), pregnant patients ([Sidebottom
2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22983357){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}), and in an occupational health setting ([Volker
2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26377480){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}).

A meta-analysis of 29 studies including 6,725 patients found
similar sensitivity (88%, 95% CI 83-92%) and specificity (85%, 95%
CI 82-88%) for a cutoff of ≥10 as did the previous studies, both overall
and for subgroups. Notably, they found that when used in the primary
care setting, only approximately 50% of patients screening positive on
the PHQ-9 in fact had major depression ([Levis
2019](https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1476){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}).
