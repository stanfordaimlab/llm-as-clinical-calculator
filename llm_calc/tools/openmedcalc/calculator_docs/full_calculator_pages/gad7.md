## FORMULA

0-21 score, with 0-3 points for each of seven questions.

## FACTS & FIGURES

For all questions, answer with one of the following:

-   Not at all = 0
-   Several days = +1
-   More than half the days = +2
-   Nearly every day = +3

The last question of the GAD-7 is a good indicator of patient\'s global
impairment, though not included in the final calculation of points.

## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

Initially validated in 2149 patients as a diagnostic tool for GAD
(cutoff score 10-\> sensitivity 89%, specificity 82%, test-retest
reliability with ICC=0.83) ([Spitzer RL
2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16717171){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}), the GAD-7 was later also found to have reasonable
sensitivity and specificity as a screener for panic disorder, social
phobia and PTSD (cutoff score 8- sensitivity 77%, specificity 82%;
cutoff score 10 - sensitivity 68% and specificity 88% for any anxiety
disorder). ([Kroenke K
2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17339617){target="_blank"
