## EVIDENCE APPRAISAL

The original study by Centor et al was done in 1981 to develop criteria
to diagnose GAS infection in adult patients presenting to the emergency
department with sore throat ([Centor
1981](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6763125){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}). The original model designated four criteria: tonsillar
exudates, swollen tender anterior cervical nodes, absence of a cough,
and history of fever. Patients exhibiting all four variables had a 56%
probability of a Group A beta strep positive culture; three variables,
32%; two variables, 15%; one variable, 6.5%; and zero variables, 2.5%.

The Centor Score was later modified to include age ([McIsaac
1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9475915){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}) and validated ([McIsaac
2004](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=198485){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"}) for use in both children and adults presenting with
sore throat. McIsaac et al (1998) determined that using the Centor Score
would reduce the number of unnecessary initial antibiotic prescriptions
by 48%, without an increase in throat culture use.

The Centor Score and its modifications were derived in relatively small
samples (n=286 and n=521, respectively). In order to more precisely
classify the risk of GAS infection, [Fine et al
(2012)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627733/){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} performed a national-scale validation of the score on a
geographically diverse population of over 140,000 patients presenting in
a clinical setting. The study was carried out over the course of more
than a year, mitigating any impact of seasonality of GAS incidence on
the results. This analysis provided more precise interpretations of risk
for each category of the Centor Score; these still fell within the 95%
confidence interval of Centor\'s original study with a much smaller
sample size.

In their comparison of the Centor Score with other identification and
treatment strategies, McIsaac et al (2004) found that use of the score
resulted in fewer overall tests (cultures and rapid tests) per person
but more throat cultures (96.1% of adults) than other strategies. As a
result, the Centor Score represented a compromise, requiring the least
diagnostic testing, providing 100% sensitivity and greater than 90%
specificity in both children and adults, and producing significant
reductions in unnecessary use of antibiotics, compared to other
strategies.

[Harris et al
(2016)](https://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2481815){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} encourage the use of the Centor Score primarily to
identify patients with a low probability of Group A streptococcal
pharyngitis who do not warrant further testing, citing the criteria\'s
low positive predictive value.
