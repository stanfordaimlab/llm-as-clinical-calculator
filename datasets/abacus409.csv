      2. Assignment Error (Secondary Error): Even though the code didn't execute properly, we can see the AI was planning to assign incorrect point values. For example:
      - For GCS of 3 (which is <6), it would have assigned 3 points when it should be 4 points
      - For the respiratory component, it was planning to assign 3 points for PaO2/FiO2 <100 without considering mechanical ventilation status, when the correct scoring requires knowledge of mechanical ventilation status to properly assign points

The patient exhibits forced deviation of the eyes, unable to move them past the midline in one direction. The patient demonstrates bilateral hemianopia, showing no response to visual stimuli in both right and left visual fields. Facial movements appear symmetrical and normal when the patient smiles and shows their teeth. When asked to raise the left arm, the patient can lift it against gravity but cannot maintain the position for the full 10 seconds. The right arm falls immediately when the patient attempts to raise it, showing no effort against gravity. The patient is unable to produce any voluntary movement in the left leg. It is observed that the patient's right leg begins to drift downward within 5 seconds but does not hit the bed. Ataxia is observed in both legs when the patient attempts coordination tests. The patient demonstrates severe or total loss of sensation, unable to feel the pinprick stimulus on one side of the body. It is noted that the patient has some difficulty communicating, struggling to name objects or construct complex sentences. It is observed that the patient's speech is slurred but mostly intelligible.
